A program that converts messages which are saved in the result.json file, generates an .html file containing histograms of the number of written messages (#in and #out) from a given hour.
The configuration data is in the config.txt file. 
Examples of the program's operation are presented in the files:
input-> result.json
output-> histogram.html
